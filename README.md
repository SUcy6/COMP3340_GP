# COMP3340_Group16_GP üèÜ

### **Connecting low-level image processing and high-level vision for degraded image classification**

### üìãProgress:

**Project Proposal** on Sep 16: [proposal](https://github.com/SUcy6/COMP3340_GP/blob/main/COMP3340_Group%2016_Proposal.pdf)

**Midterm Report** on Oct 30:

To test baseline CNN on degraded images - [Robustness_on_CIFAR100-C_CIFAR10-C](https://github.com/shaktiwadekar9/Robustness_on_CIFAR100-C_CIFAR10-C)

Results on degraded imageset CIFAR100-C are [here](https://github.com/SUcy6/COMP3340_GP/tree/main/cifar100-C_results)

**Final presentation slides**: done before Nov 22

1. (before Nov 11) Read papers - Train new models - decide which one to use  

2. (before Nov 18) Two groups: 
- train and eval baseline CNN on degraded images
- train newly proposed one and get results
                               
3. (before Nov 21) slides - 5 pages (Intro, baseline models, limits of baseline, newly proposed model, results analysis)

update: 

- [DeepDenoising](https://github.com/Ding-Liu/DeepDenoising) have errors
- TENET still not working
- Try rewrite low pass activation layer to python and test [LP-ReLU](https://github.com/tahmid0007/Low_Pass_ReLU), and analyse the influence of activation function on CNNs
- [Evaluate on CIFAR10-C](https://github.com/tanimutomo/cifar10-c-eval)
- [CIFAR10-CNN](https://github.com/GeekAlexis/cifar10-cnn/blob/master/CIFAR_10_CNN.ipynb)

**Final report**:

## üìäDatasets

[17 Category Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/): a 17 category flower dataset with 80 images for each class

[Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness to Common Corruptions and Perturbations](https://github.com/hendrycks/robustness): Tiny ImageNet-C, CIFAR-10-C

### Data Prepare

**For Oxford flower17:**

1. Download the images from [17 Category Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/)
2. Extract the file and get a **jpg** folder with all the 1360 images
3. Build a new data folder containing **17 subfolders** (for categories 1 to 17)
4. separate and distribute the images to the **17 subfolders** (each 80 images is one category in Flower17)

flowers.csv: a helper csv file for distribute the images


**For degraded images:**

[CIFAR10-C](https://zenodo.org/record/2535967#.Y3SVDL1ByUk)

In CIFAR-10-C, the first 10,000 images in each .npy are the test set images corrupted at severity 1,
and the last 10,000 images are the test set images corrupted at severity five. labels.npy is the label file for all other image files.

## üìåExperiment Result

We output the training loss, validation loss, and test accuracy to csv file. From these files, we plot the graphs to visualize our experiment results.

All the output csv can be found [here](https://github.com/SUcy6/COMP3340_GP/tree/main/output).

## üè†Model Architecture

The detailed model architecture and training process can be found [here](https://github.com/SUcy6/COMP3340_GP/tree/main/Model).

To reproduce our experiment results, please download the jupyter notebooks and train on your cloud with GPU.

## üåóLow-quality image classification

In the second part of our project, we decide to test the baseline models on degraded image dataset. After that, we will try to implement the newly proposed method for low-quality image classification. They successfully combine low-level image processing with high level classification task.

## üóìÔ∏èMidterm Plan

- Build the baseline models
- training
- Test and evaluate models(plot accuracy/loss, test result)
- Report writting (further explanation)

## üìùFinal Plan
